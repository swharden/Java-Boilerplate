# Java Boilerplate

[![CI with Maven](https://github.com/swharden/Java-Boilerplate/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/swharden/Java-Boilerplate/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)

**This repository contains simple Java application.**
* [JUnit](http://junit.org) is used for testing
* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) is used to manage packaging
* [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-java-with-maven) is used for CI (continuous integration, building and testing in the cloud)

## Setting-Up the Development Environment

These are the steps I took to get the Java SDK and Maven running on Windows.

### Get JDK
* https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/

### Get Maven
* https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
* Unzip and store somewhere important

### Add Environment Variables
* `JAVA_HOME` = `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17.0.2`
* `MAVEN_HOME` = `C:\Users\scott\Documents\important\apps\apache-maven-3.8.4`

### Add Maven bin folder to your system path
* `%MAVEN_HOME%\bin`

### Confirm Maven Works
```sh
mvn -v
```

### Create a Skeleton App

* This command creates a `my-app` folder with a basic project in it.
* I made the contents of this folder the base of my repository.

```
mvn -B archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.mycompany.app -DartifactId=my-app -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=1.4
```

### Java Project Structure

Notice the pairing of folder hierarchy between Java classes and their tests.

```
my-app
|-- pom.xml
`-- src
    |-- main
    |   `-- java
    |       `-- com
    |           `-- mycompany
    |               `-- app
    |                   `-- App.java
    `-- test
        `-- java
            `-- com
                `-- mycompany
                    `-- app
                        `-- AppTest.java
```

### Ignored Files and Folders

You may wish to add the following to your `.gitignore` file so these files and folders are not tracked by source control:

```
### Maven
target/
pom.xml.tag
pom.xml.releaseBackup
pom.xml.versionsBackup
pom.xml.next
release.properties
dependency-reduced-pom.xml
buildNumber.properties
.mvn/timing.properties
.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.jar
.project
.classpath

### Java
*.class
*.log
*.ctxt
.mtj.tmp/
*.jar
*.war
*.nar
*.ear
*.zip
*.tar.gz
*.rar
hs_err_pid*
```

### Customize the Project Object Model (POM)

See [Introduction to the POM](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html) for details

* **`groupId`** is the unique identifier of the organization or group that created the project.
  * The groupId is one of the key identifiers of a project and is typically based on the fully qualified domain name of your organization.
  * For example `org.apache.maven.plugins` is the designated groupId for all Maven plugins.

* **`artifactId`** is the unique base name of the primary artifact being generated by this project.
  * The primary artifact for a project is typically a JAR file. 
  * Secondary artifacts like source bundles also use the artifactId as part of their final name. 
  * Typical artifacts have the form `myapp-1.0.jar`

* **`version`** is the version of the artifact generated by the project.

* **`name`** is the display name used for the project.

* **`url`** is where the project's site can be found.

* **`properties`** contains value placeholders accessible anywhere within a POM.

* **`dependencies`** is the cornerstone of the POM.

* **`build`** handles things like declaring your project's directory structure and managing plugins.

### Build and Test
Example commands:
* `mvn compile`
* `mvn test`

### Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

* See [ci.yaml](.github/workflows/ci.yaml) for actual workflow file used by this repository

* See [actions/setup-java](https://github.com/actions/setup-java) for Java action documentation

* See [Building and testing Java with Maven](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/automating-builds-and-tests/building-and-testing-java-with-maven) for Maven-specific Action documentation
